This is a classroom project that We group of 3 people worked on and I was the lucky one who got the chance to lead the group.
We developed the whole database by ourself and made function using PL/SQL. We also connected the database with the C++ coded file and connected both the environments.
We got 1st price in the whole class for performance of our project and using clean code practices.
 
The file User Guide displays the functioning of the app created using C++ and accessing the database through PL/SQL procedures.
